## Life Cycle Assessment of the Coal Power Plant Units in China

### 1) Integration of other data resources into the database
There are several data resources in Chinese that give more information about the units. And they are:
1) The data from China Electricity Council (CEC);
2) The data from China Energy Statistical Yearbook (Yearbook);
3) The data from wikipedia (wiki);
4) The data from China State Grid (SGCC).

### 2) heavy metal emission model and LCIA for coal power plants
In this part, a heavy metal model was first built to calculate the heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se) emissions in the flue gas of coal power plants. Characterization factors have been calculated with the adjusted USE-tox model. Life Cycle Impact is calculated with the amount of emissions and the characterization factors.
